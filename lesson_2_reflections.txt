What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A: It sets up a hidden directory ".git" and initializes the repository. This is a first step towards adding files to track so their various changes may be noted in the repository.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
A: It allows a slow build up of elements, tracking of said elements before making a full commit.
